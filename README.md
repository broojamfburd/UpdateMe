# UpdateMe
Work in progress.

This is a stripped down, simple version of an app like Nudge. As Nudge has gotten more complex, I made a very stripped-down version whcih simply prompts a user to update their machine every X hours (default is 12). This is fully customizable. Once they choose "Update Now" it brings them to System Preferences > General> Software Updates. 

The script also checks if Zoom is active before running (planned to add in other features, such as screen sharing or camera being on).

This is still a work in progress.
